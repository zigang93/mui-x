# Data grid - Editing

<p class="description">The data grid has built-in support for cell and row editing.</p>

:::warning
This page refers to the new editing API, which is not enabled by default.
To use it, add the following flag:

```tsx
<DataGrid experimentalFeatures={{ newEditingApi: true }} />
```

This additional step is required because the default editing API has a couple of issues that can only be fixed with breaking changes, that will only be possible in v6.
To avoid having to wait for the next major release window, all breaking changes needed were included inside this flag.

If you are looking for the documentation for the default editing API, visit [this page](/x/react-data-grid/editing-legacy/).
Note that it is encouraged to migrate to the new editing API since it will be enabled by default in v6.
Although it says "experimental," you can consider it stable.
:::

## Making a column editable

You can make a column editable by enabling the `editable` property in its [column definition](/x/api/data-grid/grid-col-def/):

```tsx
<DataGrid columns={[{ field: 'name', editable: true }]} />
```

This lets the user edit any cell from the specified column.
By default, only one cell at a time can have its `editMode` prop set to `"edit"`.
To let your users edit all cells in a given row simultaneously, set the `editMode` prop to `"row"`.
For more information, see [the section on row editing](#row-editing).

The following demo shows an example of how to make all columns editable.
Play with it by double-clicking or pressing <kbd class="key">Enter</kbd> in any cell from this column:

{{"demo": "BasicEditingGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Start editing

Users can start editing a cell (or row if `editMode="row"`) with any of the following actions:

- Double-clicking a cell
- Pressing <kbd class="key">Enter</kbd>, <kbd class="key">Backspace</kbd> or <kbd class="key">Delete</kbd>—note that the latter two options both delete any existing content
- Pressing any printable key, such as <kbd class="key">a</kbd>, <kbd class="key">E</kbd>, <kbd class="key">0</kbd>, or <kbd class="key">$</kbd>
- Calling `apiRef.current.startCellEditMode` passing the row ID and column field of the cell to be edited

  ```tsx
  apiRef.current.startCellEditMode({ id: 1, field: 'name' });
  ```

- Calling `apiRef.current.startRowEditMode` passing the ID of the row (only available if `editMode="row"`).

  ```tsx
  apiRef.current.startRowEditMode({ id: 1 });
  ```

### Stop editing

When a cell is in edit mode, the user can stop editing with any of the following interactions:

- Pressing <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd>—this also reverts any changes made
- Pressing <kbd class="key">Tab</kbd>—this also saves any changes made
- Pressing <kbd class="key">Enter</kbd>—this also saves any changes made and moves the focus to the next cell in the same column
- Clicking outside the cell or row—this also saves any changes made
- Calling `apiRef.current.stopCellEditMode({ id, field })` passing the row ID and column field of the cell that's been edited

  ```tsx
  apiRef.current.stopCellEditMode({ id: 1, field: 'name' });

  // or

  apiRef.current.stopCellEditMode({
    id: 1,
    field: 'name',
    ignoreModifications: true, // will also discard the changes made
  });
  ```

- Calling `apiRef.current.stopRowEditMode` passing the ID of the row (only possible if `editMode="row"`).

  ```tsx
  apiRef.current.stopRowEditMode({ id: 1 });

  // or

  apiRef.current.stopRowEditMode({
    id: 1,
    ignoreModifications: true, // will also discard the changes made
  });
  ```

### Disable editing of specific cells within a row

The `editable` property controls which cells are editable at the column level.
You can use the `isCellEditable` callback prop to define which individual cells the user can edit in a given row.
It is called with a [`GridCellParams`](/x/api/data-grid/grid-cell-params/) object and must return `true` if the cell is editable, or `false` if not.

In the following demo, only the rows with an even `Age` value are editable.
The editable cells have a green background for better visibility.

{{"demo": "IsCellEditableGrid.js", "bg": "inline"}}

## Value parser and value setter

You can use the `valueParser` property in the column definition to modify the value entered by the user—for example, to convert the value to a different format:

```tsx
const columns: GridColDef[] = [
  {
    valueParser: (value: GridCellValue, params: GridCellParams) => {
      return value.toLowerCase();
    },
  },
];
```

You can use the `valueSetter` property of the column definition to customize how the row is updated with a new value.
This lets you insert a value from a nested object.
It is called with an object containing the new cell value to be saved as well as the row that the cell belongs to.
If you are already using a `valueGetter` to extract the value from a nested object, then the `valueSetter` will probably also be necessary.

```tsx
const columns: GridColDef[] = [
  {
    valueSetter: (params: GridValueSetterParams) => {
      const [firstName, lastName] = params.value!.toString().split(' ');
      return { ...params.row, firstName, lastName };
    },
  },
];
```

In the following demo, both the `valueParser` and the `valueSetter` are defined for the **Full name** column.
The `valueParser` capitalizes the value entered, and the `valueSetter` splits the value and saves it correctly into the row model:

{{"demo": "ValueParserSetterGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Events

The mouse and keyboard interactions that [start](#start-editing) and [stop](#stop-editing) cell editing do so by triggering the `'cellEditStart'` and `'cellEditStop'` [events](/x/react-data-grid/events/), respectively.
For row editing, the events are `'rowEditStart'` and `'rowEditStop'`.
You can control how these events are handled to customize editing behavior.

For convenience, you can also listen to these events using their respective props:

- `onCellEditStart`
- `onCellEditStop`
- `onRowEditStart`
- `onRowEditStop`

These events and props are called with an object containing the row ID and column field of the cell that is being edited.
The object also contains a `reason` param that specifies which type of interaction caused the event to be fired—for instance, `'cellDoubleClick'` when a double-click initiates edit mode.

The following demo shows how to prevent the user from exiting edit mode when clicking outside of a cell.
To do this, the `onCellEditStop` prop is used to check if the `reason` is `'cellFocusOut'`.
If that condition is true, it [disables](/x/react-data-grid/events/#disabling-the-default-behavior) the default event behavior.
In this context, the user can only stop editing a cell by pressing <kbd class="key">Enter</kbd>, <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd> or <kbd class="key">Tab</kbd>.

{{"demo": "DisableStopEditModeOnFocusOut.js", "bg": "inline"}}

## Controlled mode

Each cell and row has two modes: `edit` and `view`.
You can control the active mode using the props `cellModesModel` and `rowModesModel` (only works if `editMode="row"`).

The `cellModesModel` prop accepts an object containing the `mode` (and additional options) for a given column field, in a given row, as in the following example.
The options accepted are the same available in [`apiRef.current.startCellEditMode`](#start-editing) and [`apiRef.current.stopCellEditMode`](#stop-editing).

```tsx
// Changes the mode of field=name from row with id=1 to "edit"
<DataGrid
  cellModesModel={{ 1: { name: { mode: GridCellModes.Edit } } }}
/>

// Changes the mode of field=name from row with id=1 to "view", ignoring modifications made
<DataGrid
  cellModesModel={{ 1: { name: { mode: GridCellModes.View, ignoreModifications: true } } }}
/>
```

For row editing, the `rowModesModel` props work in a similar manner.
The options accepted are the same available in [`apiRef.current.startRowEditMode`](#start-editing) and [`apiRef.current.stopRowEditMode`](#stop-editing).

```tsx
// Changes the mode of the row with id=1 to "edit"
<DataGrid
  editMode="row"
  rowModesModel={{ 1: { mode: GridRowModes.Edit } }}
/>

// Changes the mode of the row with id=1 to "view", ignoring modifications made
<DataGrid
  editMode="row"
  rowModesModel={{ 1: { mode: GridRowModes.View, ignoreModifications: true } }}
/>
```

Additionally, the callback props `onCellModesModelChange` and `onRowModesModelChange` (only works if `editMode="row"`) are available.
Use them to update the respective prop.

In the demo below, `cellModesModel` is used to control the mode of selected cell using the external buttons.
For an example using row editing check the [full-featured CRUD component](#full-featured-crud-component).

{{"demo": "StartEditButtonGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

:::warning
The options passed to both model props only take effect when `mode` changes.
Updating the params of a cell or row, but keeping the same `mode`, makes the cell or row to stay in the same mode.
Also, removing one field or row ID from the object will not cause the missing cell or row to go to `"view"` mode.
:::

## Validation

If the column definition sets a callback for the `preProcessEditCellProps` property, then it will be called each time a new value is entered into a cell from this column.
This property lets you pre-process the props that are passed to the edit component.
The `preProcessEditCellProps` callback is called with an object containing the following attributes:

- `id`: the row ID
- `row`: the row model containing the value(s) of the cell or row before entering edit mode
- `props`: the props, containing the value after the value parser, that are passed to the edit component
- `hasChanged`: determines if `props.value` is different from the last time this callback was called

Data validation is one type of pre-processing that can be done in this way.
To validate the data entered, pass a callback to `preProcessEditCellProps` checking if `props.value` is valid.
If the new value is invalid, set `props.error` to a truthy value and return the modified props, as shown in the example below.
When the user tries to save the updated value, the change will be rejected if the error attribute is truthy (invalid).

```tsx
const columns: GridColDef[] = [
  {
    field: 'firstName',
    preProcessEditCellProps: (params: GridPreProcessEditCellProps) => {
      const hasError = params.props.value.length < 3;
      return { ...params.props, error: hasError };
    },
  },
];
```

:::warning
Changing `props.value` inside the callback has no effect. To pre-process it, use a [value parser](#value-parser-and-value-setter).
:::

The demo below contains an example of server-side data validation.
In this case, the callback returns a promise that resolves to the modified props.
Note that the value passed to `props.error` is passed directly to the edit component as the `error` prop.
While the promise is not resolved, the edit component will receive an `isProcessingProps` prop with value equal to `true`.

{{"demo": "ValidateServerNameGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

:::warning
If the user performs an action that saves changes and exits edit mode (e.g. pressing <kbd class="key">Enter</kbd>) while the props are still being processed, the changes will be discarded upon exit.
To avoid this, it is important to communicate to users when the processing is still occurring.
You can use the `isProcessingProps` prop to show a loader while waiting for the server to respond.
:::

## Persistence

The `processRowUpdate` prop is called when the user performs an action to [stop editing](#stop-editing).
Use this prop to send the new values to the server and save them into a database or other storage method.
The prop is called with two arguments:

1. the updated row with the new values after passing through the `valueSetter`
2. the values of the row before the cell or row was edited

Once the row is saved, `processRowUpdate` must return the row object that will be used to update the internal state.
The value returned is used as an argument to a call to `apiRef.current.updateRows`.

If you need to cancel the save process while calling `processRowUpdate`—for instance, when a database validation fails, or the user wants to reject the changes—there are two options:

1. Reject the promise so that the internal state is not updated and the cell remains in edit mode
2. Resolve the promise with the second argument—the original value(s)—so that the internal state is not updated, but the cell exits edit mode

The following demo implements the first option: rejecting the promise.
Instead of [validating](#validation) while typing, it validates in the server.
If the new name is empty, then the promise responsible for saving the row will be rejected and the cell will remain in edit mode.
Additionally, `onProcessRowUpdateError` is called to display the error message.
The demo also shows that `processRowUpdate` can be used to pre-process the row model that will be saved into the internal state.
To exit edit mode, press <kbd class="key">Escape</kbd> or enter a valid name.

{{"demo": "ServerSidePersistence.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Ask for confirmation before saving

The second option—resolving the promise with the second argument—lets the user cancel the save process by rejecting the changes and exiting edit mode.
In this case, `processRowUpdate` is resolved with the second argument—the original value(s) of the cell or row.

The following demo shows how this approach can be used to ask for confirmation before sending the data to the server.
If the user accepts the change, the internal state is updated with the values.
But if the changes are rejected, the internal state remains unchanged, and the cell is reverted back to its original value.
The demo also employs validation to prevent entering an empty name.

{{"demo": "AskConfirmationBeforeSave.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Create your own edit component

Each of the built-in column types provides a component to edit the value of the cells.
To customize column types, or override the existing components, you can provide a new edit component through the `renderEditCell` property in the column definition.
This property works like the `renderCell` property, which is rendered while cells are in view mode.

```tsx
function CustomEditComponent(props: GridRenderEditCellParams) {
  return <input type="text" value={params.value} onValueChange={...}>;
}

const columns: GridColDef[] = [
  {
    field: 'firstName',
    renderEditCell: (params: GridRenderEditCellParams) => (
      return <CustomEditComponent {...params} />;
    ),
  },
];
```

The `renderEditCell` property receives all params from `GridRenderEditCellParams`, which extends `GridCellParams`.
Additionally, the props added during [pre-processing](#validation) are also available in the params.
These are the most important params to consider:

- `value`: contains the current value of the cell in edit mode, overriding the value from `GridCellParams`
- `error`: the error added during validation
- `isProcessingProps`: whether `preProcessEditCellProps` is being executed or not

Once a new value is entered into the input, it must be sent to the grid.
To do this, pass the row ID, the column field, and the new cell value to a call to `apiRef.current.setEditCellValue`.
The new value will be parsed and validated, and the `value` prop will reflect the changes in the next render.

```tsx
function CustomEditComponent(props: GridRenderEditCellParams) {
  const { id, value, field } = props;
  const apiRef = useGridApiContext();

  const handleValueChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const newValue = event.target.value; // The new value entered by the user
    apiRef.current.setEditCellValue({ id, field, value: newValue });
  };

  return <input type="text" value={value} onValueChange={handleValueChange}>;
}
```

The following demo implements a custom edit component, based on the [`Rating`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-rating/) component from `@mui/material`, for the **Rating** column.

{{"demo": "CustomEditComponent.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### With debounce

By default, each call to `apiRef.current.setEditCellValue` triggers a new render.
If the edit component requires the user to type a new value, re-rendering the grid too often will drastically reduce performance.
One way to avoid this is to debounce the API calls.
You can use `apiRef.current.setEditCellValue` to handle debouncing by setting the `debounceMs` param to a positive integer that defines a set time period in milliseconds.
No matter how many times the API method is called, the grid will only be re-rendered after that period of time has passed.

```tsx
apiRef.current.setEditCellValue({ id, field, value: newValue, debounceMs: 200 });
```

When the grid is only set to re-render after a given period of time has passed, the `value` prop will not be updated on each `apiRef.current.setEditCellValue` call.
To avoid a frozen UI, the edit component can keep the current value in an internal state and sync it once `value` changes.
Modify the edit component to enable this feature:

```diff
 function CustomEditComponent(props: GridRenderEditCellParams) {
-  const { id, value, field } = props;
+  const { id, value: valueProp, field } = props;
+  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(valueProp);
   const apiRef = useGridApiContext();

   const handleChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
     const newValue = event.target.value; // The new value entered by the user
-    apiRef.current.setEditCellValue({ id, field, value: newValue });
+    apiRef.current.setEditCellValue({ id, field, value: newValue, debounceMs: 200 });
+    setValue(newValue);
   };

+  React.useEffect(() => {
+    setValue(valueProp);
+  }, [valueProp]);
+
   return <input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange}>;
}
```

### With auto-stop

An edit component has "auto-stop" behavior when it stops edit mode as soon as the value is changed.
To picture better, imagine an edit component with a combo, created following the normal [steps](#create-your-own-edit-component).
By default, it would require two clicks to change the value of the cell: one click inside the cell to select a new value, and another click outside the cell to save.
This second click can be avoided if the first click also stops the edit mode.
To create an edit component with auto-stop, call `apiRef.current.stopCellEditMode` after setting the new value.
Since `apiRef.current.setEditCellValue` may do additional processing, you must wait for it to resolve before stopping the edit mode.
Also, it is a good practice to check if `apiRef.current.setEditCellValue` has returned `true`.
It will be `false` if `preProcessEditProps` set an error during [validation](#validation).

```tsx
const handleChange = async (event: SelectChangeEvent) => {
  const isValid = await apiRef.current.setEditCellValue({
    id,
    field,
    value: event.target.value,
  });

  if (isValid) {
    apiRef.current.stopCellEditMode({ id, field });
  }
};
```

The following demo implements an edit component with auto-stop, based on a native [`Select`](/material-ui/react-select/) component for the **Role** column.

{{"demo": "AutoStopEditComponent.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

:::warning
We don't recommend using edit components with auto-stop in columns that use long-running `preProcessEditCellProps` because the UI will freeze while waiting for `apiRef.current.setEditCellValue`.
Instead, use the provided interactions to exit edit mode.
:::

## Row editing

Row editing lets the user edit all cells in a row simultaneously.
The same basic rules for cell editing also apply to row editing.
To enable it, change the `editMode` prop to `"row"`, then follow the same guidelines as those for cell editing to set the `editable` property in the definition of the columns that the user can edit.

```tsx
<DataGrid editMode="row" columns={[{ field: 'name', editable: true }]} />
```

The following demo illustrates how row editing works.
The user can [start](#start-editing) and [stop](#stop-editing) editing a row using the same actions as those provided for cell editing (e.g. double-clicking a cell).

{{"demo": "BasicRowEditingGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

:::warning
By design, when changing the value of a cell all `preProcessEditCellProps` callbacks from other columns are also called.
This lets you apply conditional validation where the value of a cell impacts the validation status of another cell in the same row.
If you only want to run validation when the value has changed, check if the `hasChanged` param is `true`.
:::

### Full-featured CRUD component

Row editing makes it possible to create a full-featured CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) component similar to those found in enterprise applications.
In the following demo, the typical ways to start and stop editing are all disabled.
Instead, use the buttons available in each row or in the toolbar.

{{"demo": "FullFeaturedCrudGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Advanced use cases

In the next sections, there examples of how the props provided by editing API can be used to implement complex use cases commonly found in applications.

### Conditional validation

When all cells in a row are in edit mode, you can validate fields by comparing their values against one another.
To do this, start by adding the `preProcessEditCellProps` as explained in the [validation](#validation) section.
When the callback is called, it will have an additional `otherFieldsProps` param containing the props from the other fields in the same row.
Use this param to check if the value from the current column is valid or not.
Return the modified `props` containing the error as you would for cell editing.
Once at the least one field has the `error` attribute set to a truthy value, the row will not exit edit mode.

The following demo requires a value for the **Payment method** column only if the **Is paid?** column is checked:

{{"demo": "ConditionalValidationGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Linked fields

The options available for one field may depend on the value of another field.
For instance, if the `singleSelect` column is used, you can provide a function to `valueOptions` returning the relevant options for the value selected in another field, as exemplified below.

```tsx
const columns: GridColDef[] = [
  {
    field: 'account',
    type: 'singleSelect',
    valueOptions: ({ row }) => {
      if (!row) {
        // The row is not available when filtering this column
        return ['Sales', 'Investments', 'Ads', 'Taxes', 'Payroll', 'Utilities'];
      }

      return row.type === 'Income' // Gets the value of the "type" field
        ? ['Sales', 'Investments', 'Ads']
        : ['Taxes', 'Payroll', 'Utilities'];
    },
  },
];
```

The code above is already enough to display different options in the **Account** column based on the value selected in the **Type** column.
The only task left is to reset the account once the type is changed.
This is needed because the previously selected account will not exist now in the options.
To solve that, you can create a custom edit component, reusing the built-in one, and pass a function to the `onValueChange` prop.
This function should call `apiRef.current.setEditCellValue` to reset the value of the other field.

```tsx
const CustomTypeEditComponent = (props: GridEditSingleSelectCellProps) => {
  const apiRef = useGridApiContext();

  const handleValueChange = async () => {
    await apiRef.current.setEditCellValue({
      id: props.id,
      field: 'account',
      value: '',
    });
  };

  return <GridEditSingleSelectCell onValueChange={handleValueChange} {...props} />;
};
```

The demo below combines the steps showed above.
You can experiment it by changing the value of any cell in the **Type** column.
The **Account** column is automatically updated with the correct options.

{{"demo": "LinkedFieldsRowEditing.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

:::warning
The call to `apiRef.current.setEditCellValue` returns a promise that must be awaited.
For instance, if the `singleSelect` column type is used, not awaiting will cause the other column to be rendered with a `value` that is not in the options.

```ts
const handleChange = async () => {
  await apiRef.current.setEditCellValue({
    id: props.id,
    field: 'account',
    value: '',
  });
};
```

:::

A similar behavior can be reproduced with cell editing.
Instead of `apiRef.current.setEditCellValue`, the `rows` prop must be updated or `apiRef.current.updateRows` be used.
Note that the `onCellEditStart` and `onCellEditStop` props also have to be used to revert the value of the cell changed, in case the user cancels the edit.

{{"demo": "LinkedFieldsCellEditing.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Usage with `@mui/x-date-pickers`

By default, the grid uses native browser inputs for editing `date` and `dateTime` columns.

While [MUI X Date / Time Pickers](/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/) are not supported by the grid out of the box yet, it is easy to integrate them by creating [custom edit components](/x/react-data-grid/editing/#create-your-own-edit-component) and [custom filter operators](/x/react-data-grid/filtering/#create-a-custom-operator).

The example below uses `@mui/x-date-pickers` for both `date` and `dateTime` column types:

{{"demo": "EditingWithDatePickers.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false }}

:::warning
You can change date format by importing different locale (`en-US` locale is used in the example above).
See [Localization](/x/react-date-pickers/localization/) for more information.
