# Data grid - Tree data [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](https://mui.com/store/items/mui-x-pro/)

<p class="description">Use Tree data to handle rows with parent / child relationship.</p>

To enable the Tree data, you simply have to use the `treeData` prop as well as provide a `getTreeDataPath` prop.
The `getTreeDataPath` function returns an array of strings which represents the path to a given row.

```tsx
// The following examples will both render the same tree
// - Sarah
//     - Thomas
//         - Robert
//         - Karen

const columns: GridColumns = [{ field: 'jobTitle', width: 250 }];

// Without transformation
const rows: GridRowsProp = [
  { path: ['Sarah'], jobTitle: 'CEO', id: 0 },
  { path: ['Sarah', 'Thomas'], jobTitle: 'Head of Sales', id: 1 },
  { path: ['Sarah', 'Thomas', 'Robert'], jobTitle: 'Sales Person', id: 2 },
  { path: ['Sarah', 'Thomas', 'Karen'], jobTitle: 'Sales Person', id: 3 },
];

<DataGridPro
  treeData
  getTreeDataPath={(row) => row.path}
  rows={rows}
  columns={columns}
/>;

// With transformation
const rows: GridRowsProp = [
  { path: 'Sarah', jobTitle: 'CEO', id: 0 },
  { path: 'Sarah/Thomas', jobTitle: 'Head of Sales', id: 1 },
  { path: 'Sarah/Thomas/Robert', jobTitle: 'Sales Person', id: 2 },
  { path: 'Sarah/Thomas/Karen', jobTitle: 'Sales Person', id: 3 },
];

<DataGridPro
  treeData
  getTreeDataPath={(row) => row.path.split('/')}
  rows={rows}
  columns={columns}
/>;
```

## Custom grouping column

Same behavior as for the [Row grouping](/x/react-data-grid/row-grouping/#grouping-columns) except for the `leafField` and `mainGroupingCriteria` which are not applicable for the Tree data.

{{"demo": "TreeDataCustomGroupingColumn.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Accessing the grouping column field

If you want to access the grouping column field, for instance, to use it with column pinning, the `GRID_TREE_DATA_GROUPING_FIELD` constant is available.

```tsx
<DataGridPro
  treeData
  initialState={{
    pinnedColumns: {
      left: [GRID_TREE_DATA_GROUPING_FIELD],
    },
  }}
  {...otherProps}
/>
```

## Group expansion

Same behavior as for the [Row grouping](/x/react-data-grid/row-grouping/#group-expansion).

## Gaps in the tree

If some entries are missing to build the full tree, the `DataGridPro` will automatically create rows to fill those gaps.

{{"demo": "TreeDataWithGap.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Filtering

A node is included if one of the following criteria is met:

- at least one of its descendants is passing the filters
- it is passing the filters

By default, the filtering is applied to every depth of the tree.
You can limit the filtering to the top-level rows with the `disableChildrenFiltering` prop.

{{"demo": "TreeDataDisableChildrenFiltering.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Sorting

By default, the sorting is applied to every depth of the tree.
You can limit the sorting to the top-level rows with the `disableChildrenSorting` prop.

{{"demo": "TreeDataDisableChildrenSorting.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

> If you are using `sortingMode="server"`, you need to always put the children of a row after its parent.
> For instance:
>
> ```ts
> // ‚úÖ The row A.A is immediately after its parent
> const validRows = [{ path: ['A'] }, { path: ['A', 'A'] }, { path: ['B'] }];
>
> // ‚ùå The row A.A is not immediately after its parent
> const invalidRows = [{ path: ['A'] }, { path: ['B'] }, { path: ['A', 'A'] }];
> ```

## Children lazy-loading

:::warning
This feature isn't implemented yet. It's coming.

üëç Upvote [issue #3377](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/3377) if you want to see it land faster.

Alternatively, you can achieve a similar behavior by implementing this feature outside the component as shown below.
This implementation does not support every feature of the grid but can be a good starting point for large datasets.

The idea is to add a property `descendantCount` on the row and to use it instead of the internal grid state.
To do so, we need to override both the `renderCell` of the grouping column and to manually open the rows by listening to `rowExpansionChange` event.
